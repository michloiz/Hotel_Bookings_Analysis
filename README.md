This independent project analyzes 119,390 hotel bookings (2015–2017) to deliver hospitality insights using **BigQuery SQL**, **R** (tidyverse, ggplot2), **Google Sheets**, and **Tableau**. It uncovers trends in bookings, cancellations, and customer behavior, providing actionable, data-driven recommendations. This complements my [Bellabeat Analysis](#) project for a diverse portfolio targeting data analyst roles.
